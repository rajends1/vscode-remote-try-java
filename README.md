# Try Out Development Containers: Java

This is a sample project to go along with the "try" quick start for the **VS Code Remote - Containers** extension.

Using the sample:
1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set evrything up correctly.
2) If you're not yet in a development container, use `Remote - Container: Reopen Folder in Container` from the Command Palette. You activate the command palette with <kbd>F1</kbd>.
3. Edit files, launch the program, and try things out!
